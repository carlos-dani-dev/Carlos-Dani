  <h3>🗣️ About me</h3>
  <p>My name is Carlos and im 18 years old. Currently i am in my second college year (3º período na maioria das universidades brasileiras) and hopefully by 2025 i will have a Computer Science degree from UFPI
  - Universidade Federal do Piauí (Federal University of Piauí). Since i was 10 creative thinking fascinated me, CANGURU Mathematics Olympiad and the Brazilian Methmatics Olympiad helped me to experience it. In my journey i discovered that
  the common way was rarely the best way, most of the times feeling in one's own skin. </p>
